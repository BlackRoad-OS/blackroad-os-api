# Blackroad OS · API Service (Gen-0)

A minimal FastAPI 0.110 scaffold with Celery stubs for background work. Built to sit behind Operator & Prism layers.

## Infrastructure

This service is part of the BlackRoad OS infrastructure. See [INFRASTRUCTURE.md](./INFRASTRUCTURE.md) for the complete architecture, deployment, and operations guide.

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# → http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t blackroad/api:0.0.1 . -f infra/Dockerfile
docker run -e PORT=8000 -p 8000:8000 blackroad/api:0.0.1
```

## Endpoints

- `GET /health` returns `{ "status": "ok", "uptime": seconds }`.
- `GET /version` returns `{ "version": "0.0.1", "commit": GIT_SHA }` sourced from environment.

## Tasks

Celery 5 is wired via `app/workers/sample_task.py`. Configure `CELERY_BROKER_URL` in the environment to dispatch jobs; the sample task logs and echoes incoming payloads.
`blackroad-os-api` is the typed HTTP surface for BlackRoad OS. It exposes versioned JSON endpoints that Prism Console and other clients use to query health, agents, finance, events, and RoadChain data. This service participates in the shared **"BlackRoad OS - Master Orchestration"** project alongside Operator, Core, Prism, Web, and Infra.

## Standard Infrastructure Endpoints

These endpoints follow BlackRoad OS service conventions and are available at the root level:

- `GET /health` – Lightweight liveness check (returns 200 if service is running)
- `GET /ready` – Readiness check for load balancers (checks basic service configuration)
- `GET /version` – Service version, commit, and environment info

## Core Endpoints
All routes are prefixed with `/api/v1` and return the standard `{ ok, data | error }` envelope.

- `GET /api/v1/health` – API + dependency health summary
- `GET /api/v1/system/overview` – Aggregated system status and recent metrics
- `GET /api/v1/agents` – List agents with optional `status` and `q` filters
- `GET /api/v1/agents/:id` – Agent detail
- `GET /api/v1/finance/snapshot` – Finance/treasury snapshot
- `GET /api/v1/events` – Recent journal-style events with optional filters
- `GET /api/v1/roadchain/blocks` – RoadChain block headers (mocked for now)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build and start production bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm start
   ```

The server listens on `http://localhost:4000` by default or the configured `PORT`.

## Configuration

Runtime settings live in `app/core/settings.py` using Pydantic v2 `BaseSettings`.
- `GIT_SHA` (default `unknown`) annotates the running commit.
- `CELERY_BROKER_URL` (default `memory://`) defines the Celery broker.
- `LOG_LEVEL` drives basic logging setup.

Copy `infra/api.env.example` to configure a local `.env`.

## Development
### Optional Version Info

For the `/version` endpoint, you can optionally set:
- `BR_OS_API_VERSION` – Override version (defaults to package.json version)
- `BR_OS_API_COMMIT` – Git commit hash (defaults to "UNKNOWN")
- `BR_OS_ENV` – Environment name (defaults to NODE_ENV or "local")

## Development Notes
- The API is a thin adapter: it shapes responses, validates inputs, and delegates business logic to `blackroad-os-operator` and `blackroad-os-core` when available.
- RoadChain and some finance data are mocked for now; TODO markers indicate where to swap in real upstream calls.
- Responses always follow the `{ ok: boolean; data?; error? }` envelope to keep Prism and other clients stable.
- Requests are validated with Zod via `validateRequest`; invalid params return `{ ok: false, error: { code: "INVALID_REQUEST" } }`.
- Run `npm run generate:openapi` to produce `docs/openapi.generated.json` from the runtime schemas.

- Linting: `ruff check .`
- Formatting: `black .`
- Tests: `pytest`

# BlackRoad OS – Public API

`blackroad-os-api` is the FastAPI gateway that fronts every public BlackRoad surface (operator, core, packs, etc.). The API is driven by the contract in [`openapi.yaml`](./openapi.yaml) and generated with `fastapi-codegen`.

## Quick start

```bash
poetry install
make dev
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:${PORT:-8000}` and exposes docs at `/docs`.

### Environment variables

- `OPERATOR_URL` – Base URL for the operator service (required for agent proxy & installs)
- `PACK_INDEX_URL` – URL that returns a JSON list of `blackroad-os-pack-*` packages
- `API_KEYS` – Comma-separated API keys accepted in the `X-BR-KEY` header
- `PUBLIC_API_KEY` – Additional API key accepted in the `X-BR-KEY` header
- `GIT_COMMIT` – Git SHA used for the `X-API-Version` header
- `PORT` – HTTP port (default: `8000`)

### Example calls

```bash
curl -H "X-BR-KEY: your-api-key-here" http://localhost:8000/v1/agents
curl -H "X-BR-KEY: your-api-key-here" http://localhost:8000/v1/packs
curl -H "X-BR-KEY: your-api-key-here" -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/packs/alpha/install
```

## Development

- Update the API surface by editing [`openapi.yaml`](./openapi.yaml) and regenerating the router via `fastapi-codegen --input openapi.yaml --output app/generated`.
- Run tests and contract checks with `pytest` (coverage gate at 90%).
- Schemathesis validates the live routes against the OpenAPI contract during the test suite.

## Deployment

The multi-stage Dockerfile builds a Poetry-based image that serves FastAPI with uvicorn. Railway deployments use `/v1/health` for health checks.
