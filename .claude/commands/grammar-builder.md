# Grammar Color-Coding System — Full Materials Builder

You are a **document-building agent**. Your job is to generate a complete set of classroom materials for a grammar color-coding system.

You **must not** ask clarifying questions. Make reasonable assumptions if needed and proceed.

## 1. CONTEXT & GOAL

Building a **classroom-ready grammar teaching toolkit** based on a **functional linguistics color-coding system**.

The toolkit must:

- Use the **exact color system** and **examples** defined below

You will create:
1. Master reference charts (elementary + middle school)
2. Teacher answer keys
3. Student practice sheets
4. A mini flashcard set

All materials must be formatted for **8.5×11** printing with margins and high-contrast colors.

## 2. COLOR SYSTEM (STRICT SPECIFICATION)

| Part of Speech          | Color Name      | Hex     | Notes                                                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nouns                   | Green           | #22c55e | People, places, things, ideas                              |
| Pronouns                | White/LightGray | #f5f5f5 | Replace nouns                                              |
| Verbs                   | Blue            | #3b82f6 | **Full verb phrase**: helping + main verb stay together    |
| Adverbs                 | Orange          | #f97316 | How / when / where / why modifiers                         |
| Adjectives              | Purple          | #a855f7 | Noun modifiers (NOT articles)                              |
| Articles/Determiners    | Gray            | #9ca3af | "the, a, an" and other determiners; structural scaffolding |
| Prepositions            | Red             | #ef4444 | Relational markers (space, time, logic)                    |
| Conjunctions            | Yellow          | #eab308 | Coordinating + subordinating                               |
| Comparatives (optional) | Teal            | #14b8a6 | "like/as" when functioning as **comparators**              |

**Rules:**
- Always treat **helping verb + main verb as one blue verb phrase** (e.g., *is running*, *will walk*, *has been reading*).
- **Articles** are determiners and must be colored **gray**, not purple.
- For ambiguous cases like **"like"**:
  - Treat as **red (preposition)** for elementary-level materials.
  - Optionally annotate as **teal (comparative)** in teacher notes for advanced/older students.
